              years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses
              (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir
              host, bats1-4. Previous studies have shown that some bat
              SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5-7. Here we report
              the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus
              (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory
              syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started
              on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed
              infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length
              genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early
              stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and
              share 79.6\% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show
              that 2019-nCoV is 96\% identical at the whole-genome level to a
              bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven
              conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus
              belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus
              isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically
              ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients.
              Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry
              receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-as SARS-CoV.",

              (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout
              China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of
              the affected patients. METHODS: We extracted data regarding 1099
              patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in
              30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China
              through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was
              admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical
              ventilation, or death. RESULTS: The median age of the patients
              was 47 years; 41.9\% of the patients were female. The primary
              composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1\%), including
              5.0\% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3\% who underwent invasive
              mechanical ventilation, and 1.4\% who died. Only 1.9\% of the
              patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among
              nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3\% had contact with residents of
              Wuhan, including 31.3\% who had visited the city. The most common
              symptoms were fever (43.8\% on admission and 88.7\% during
              hospitalization) and cough (67.8\%). Diarrhea was uncommon
              (3.8\%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile
              range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most
              common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT)
              (56.4\%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of
              877 patients (17.9\%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173
              patients (2.9\%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present
              in 83.2\% of the patients on admission. CONCLUSIONS: During the
              first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly
              throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients
              often presented without fever, and many did not have abnormal
              radiologic findings. (Funded by the National Health Commission of

  author   = "Li, Lucy M and Grassly, Nicholas C and Fraser, Christophe",
  abstract = "Heterogeneity in individual-level transmissibility can be
              quantified by the dispersion parameter k of the offspring
              distribution. Quantifying heterogeneity is important as it
              affects other parameter estimates, it modulates the degree of
              unpredictability of an epidemic, and it needs to be accounted for
              in models of infection control. Aggregated data such as incidence
              time series are often not sufficiently informative to estimate k.
              Incorporating phylogenetic analysis can help to estimate k
              concurrently with other epidemiological parameters. We have
              developed an inference framework that uses particle Markov Chain
              Monte Carlo to estimate k and other epidemiological parameters
              using both incidence time series and the pathogen phylogeny.
              Using the framework to fit a modified compartmental transmission
              model that includes the parameter k to simulated data, we found
              that more accurate and less biased estimates of the reproductive
              number were obtained by combining epidemiological and
              phylogenetic analyses. However, k was most accurately estimated
              using pathogen phylogeny alone. Accurately estimating k was
              necessary for unbiased estimates of the reproductive number, but
              it did not affect the accuracy of reporting probability and
              epidemic start date estimates. We further demonstrated that
              inference was possible in the presence of phylogenetic
              uncertainty by sampling from the posterior distribution of
              phylogenies. Finally, we used the inference framework to estimate
              transmission parameters from epidemiological and genetic data
              collected during a poliovirus outbreak. Despite the large degree
              of phylogenetic uncertainty, we demonstrated that incorporating
              phylogenetic data in parameter inference improved the accuracy
              and precision of estimates.",

              emergence",
  author   = "Lloyd-Smith, J O and Schreiber, S J and Kopp, P E and Getz, W M",
  abstract = "Population-level analyses often use average quantities to
              describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does
              not arise from identifiable groups. A prominent example, central
              to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic
              reproductive number, R(0), which is defined as the mean number of
              infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible
              population. Population estimates of R(0) can obscure considerable
              individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the
              global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by
              numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals
              infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases. For diseases
              transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or
              smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure
              empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has
              been unclear. Here we present an integrated theoretical and
              statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in
              infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data
              from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the
              distribution of individual infectiousness around R(0) is often
              highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation
              differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease
              extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive.
              Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control,
              showing that individual-specific control measures outperform
              population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements
              achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to
              identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our
              findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of
              disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a
              rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to
              predict their frequency.",

              genealogies the population dynamics of biological systems, such

              distribution affects the relationship between population dynamics
              and the genealogy, and for infectious diseases, the offspring
              distribution is often highly overdispersed. Here, we provide a
              general formula for the coalescent rate for populations with
              time-varying sizes and any offspring distribution. The formula is
              valid in the same large population limit as Kingman's original

              inference by providing a realistic prior on the distribution of
              branch lengths and times of common ancestry. The parameters of a
              population genetic model may also have intrinsic importance, and
              simultaneous estimation of a phylogeny and model parameters has
              enabled phylodynamic inference of population growth rates,
              reproduction numbers, and effective population size through time.
              Phylodynamic inference based on pathogen genetic sequence data
              has emerged as useful supplement to epidemic surveillance,
              however commonly-used mechanistic models that are typically
              fitted to non-genetic surveillance data are rarely fitted to
              pathogen genetic data due to a dearth of software tools, and the
              theory required to conduct such inference has been developed only
              recently. We present a framework for coalescent-based
              phylogenetic and phylodynamic inference which enables
              highly-flexible modeling of demographic and epidemiological
              processes. This approach builds upon previous structured
              coalescent approaches and includes enhancements for computational
              speed, accuracy, and stability. A flexible markup language is
              described for translating parametric demographic or
              epidemiological models into a structured coalescent model
              enabling simultaneous estimation of demographic or
              epidemiological parameters and time-scaled phylogenies. We
              demonstrate the utility of these approaches by fitting
              compartmental epidemiological models to Ebola virus and Influenza

              these epidemics, such as the reproduction number and epidemic

               professionals, real-time and predictive modeling of infectious
               disease is of growing importance. This book provides a timely
               and comprehensive introduction to the modeling of infectious
               diseases in humans and animals, focusing on recent developments
               as well as more traditional approaches. Matt Keeling and Pejman
               Rohani move from modeling with simple differential equations to
               more recent, complex models, where spatial structure, seasonal
               ``forcing,'' or stochasticity influence the dynamics, and where
               computer simulation needs to be used to generate theory. In each
               of the eight chapters, they deal with a specific modeling
               approach or set of techniques designed to capture a particular
               biological factor. They illustrate the methodology used with
               examples from recent research literature on human and infectious
               disease modeling, showing how such techniques can be used in
               practice. Diseases considered include BSE, foot-and-mouth, HIV,
               measles, rubella, smallpox, and West Nile virus, among others.
               Particular attention is given throughout the book to the
               development of practical models, useful both as predictive tools
               and as a means to understand fundamental epidemiological
               processes. To emphasize this approach, the last chapter is
               dedicated to modeling and understanding the control of diseases
               through vaccination, quarantine, or culling. Comprehensive,

               Many large datasets of fast-evolving viruses are not well fitted
               by molecular clock models that assume a constant substitution
               rate through time, and more flexible relaxed clock models are
               required for robust inference of rates and dates. Estimation of
